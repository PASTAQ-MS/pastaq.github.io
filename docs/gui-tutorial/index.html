        <p>
          PASTAQ-GUI can be used to setup the parameters of PASTAQâ€™s DDA
          pipeline, enabling the users to easily pre-process projects with an
          user friendly interface. Note that this application is currently in
          beta and thus unexpected errors can occur.
        </p>
        <p>
          When starting PASTAQ-GUI you will be greeted with the following
          screen:
        </p>
        <p><img src="figures/fig_1.jpg" /></p>
        <p>
          The <code>File</code> menu button will provide a drop down for file
          related actions the user can perform.
        </p>
        <p><img src="figures/fig_1,1.jpg" /></p>
        <p>
          The new project button initialize a project in the given directory,
          creating a <code>parameters.json</code> file. This directory will also
          be used as the output directory of the pipeline.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the <code>Open project</code> button, a
          <code>parameters.json</code> file can be loaded. This parameters file
          is the same that is generated in the output directory when the DDA
          pipeline is run from the GUI or using the Python bindings. This
          enables loading past projects even when the GUI was not used.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once a project is active we can edit the project name and description
          and have access to the rest of the parameters. Setting up the project
          name and description is optional but recommended to have some context
          about the analysis for the future.
        </p>
        <p><img src="figures/fig_1,2.png" /></p>
        <p>
          The first step would be to add some samples in mzXML or mzML format
          using the <code>Add</code> button in the <code>Input files</code> tab.
          Multiple files can be selected at once in the file explorer.
        </p>
        <p><img src="figures/fig_2.png" /></p>
        <p>
          Selecting multiple samples and pressing the <code>Edit</code> button
          allow us to change the sample group and add identification files in
          mzIdentML format via the browse button or simply dragging and dropping
          them. For example, in a control vs disease experiment, mark the
          samples from each group accordingly.
        </p>
        <p><img src="figures/fig_3.jpg" /></p>
        <p>
          If multiple input files are selected when assigning the identification
          files, they will be matched by the file name without the extension.
          For example <code>1_1.mzXML</code> will be matched with
          <code>1_1.mzid</code>. This allows selecting all identification files
          in a directory and letting the auto-match do the work instead of
          manually assigning each identification file to the mzXML/mzML raw
          data.
        </p>
        <p><img src="figures/fig_4.png" /></p>
        <p>Repeat this for all sample groups as needed.</p>
        <p><img src="figures/fig_5.png" /></p>
        <p>
          Alternatively if you upload the unprocessed <code>.mgf</code> files,
          the GUI is capable of automatically processing the uploaded files to
          <code>.mzID</code>. If we switch over to paths tab, provided you have
          MSFragger, idconvert and the corresponding .params loaded when running
          the pipeline the appropriate <code>.mzID</code> will be generated for
          the <code>.mzXML</code> or <code>.mzML</code>.
        </p>
        <p><img src="figures/fig_9.png" /></p>
        <p>
          Next, switch over to the parameters tab to configure the
          pre-processing settings. The default parameters should be a good
          starting point, but the user must adjust the
          <code>Instrument settings</code> to match the type of mass
          spectrometer used, the resolution at the given m/z and the expected
          average FWHM of retention time peaks (in seconds).
        </p>
        <p><img src="figures/fig_6.png" /></p>
        <p>
          In case you wish to reset the parameters back to default this can be
          achieved via the The <code>Action</code> menu button
        </p>
        <p><img src="figures/fig_6,1.png" /></p>
        <p>
          With all this in place, the project can be saved via the
          <code>File</code> menu on the top left. Otherwise pressing the
          <code>Run</code> button at the bottom of the screen the pipeline will
          be executed and the parameters will be saved automatically. The
          progress can be seen in the progress dialog pop-up, tracking each
          pre-processing. Note that while the pre-processing can be stopped at
          any time with the <code>Cancel</code> button, doing so when writing
          intermediate files to disk will result in corruption, and its not
          recommended. If this happens, deleting the corrupted files will result
          in those files being processed again in subsequent runs.
        </p>
        <p><img src="figures/fig_8.png" /></p>
        <p>
          Once the pipeline has finished, the <code>Ok</code> button will
          appear, which is safe to press to dismiss the progress dialog. Now you
          should be able to see the output files in the project directory. We
          recommend looking at the <code>quality</code> folder to explore the
          quality control plots generated by the pipeline. The different
          quantitative tables can be found on the <code>quant</code> directory.
