<h2 id="pastaq-pipelines-and-systems-for-threshold-avoiding-quantification">PASTAQ: Pipelines And Systems for Threshold Avoiding Quantification</h2>
<hr />
<p>PASTAQ provides a set of tools for high-performance pre-processing of LC-MS/MS data. Avoiding the use of arbitrary intensity thresholds in early stages of the pipeline can aid in the detection of important biological low intensity signals common in metabolomics and proteomics experiments.</p>
<p>The core of PASTAQ is implemented in C++ and currently comes in three flavours:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>A C++ library to implement new high-performance tools.</li>
<li>Python bindings for general data processing, a default Data Dependent Acquisition (DDA) pipeline, and access to the tools to build custom analysis pipelines.</li>
<li>A graphical user interface (PASTAQ-GUI) for easy parametrization of the DDA pipeline (beta).</li>
</ol>
<p>PASTAQ is suitable to build personalized pipelines using its algorithms for isotope quantification, retention time alignment, deisotoping/feature detection, can be combined with identifications obtained with any engine that outputs the mzIdentML format (and engines whose output can be converted to the mzIdentML format).</p>
<p>The default DDA pipeline can be used for proteomics and metabolomics analyses, and outputs a variety of quantitative tables as described below. It also produces quality control plots that can be used to assess the accuracy of the data and pre-processing algorithms.</p>
<p>Currently annotation of peaks and features is implemented for proteomics using mzIdentML standard, while similar annotation for metabolomics using peaks/features accurate mass and MS/MS spectra can be implemented in straightforward way.</p>
<h3 id="installation">Installation</h3>
<p>PASTAQ can be downloaded and compiled <a href="https://github.com/PASTAQ-MS/PASTAQ">from source</a> by downloading or cloning the repository and following the instructions in the <code>README.md</code>. Building from source requires CMake and a C++ compliant compiler. The default installation will build the PASTAQ C++ library and its corresponding Python bindings.</p>
<p>We also provide standalone <a href="https://github.com/PASTAQ-MS/PASTAQ-GUI">PASTAQ-GUI</a> installers for Windows in the <a href="https://github.com/PASTAQ-MS/PASTAQ-GUI/releases">release page</a>.</p>
<h3 id="basic-usage">Basic Usage</h3>
<p>The following instructions apply to the usage of PASTAQ’s built-in Python bindings.</p>
<h3 id="further-developments">Further Developments</h3>
<p>We continue to develop PASTAQ, and are always open for collaborations to add new algorithms and improve the quality of the existing tools. If you want to get involved, feel free to <a href="mailto:a.sanchez.brotons@rug.nl">get in touch</a> with us to discuss prospective projects.</p>
<h3 id="dda-pipeline-parameters">DDA Pipeline Parameters</h3>
<p>The following is an explanation of the parameters that can be configured for the DDA pipeline. In general, the default parameters can be used directly with the exception of the instrument related configuration. The following prepares the parameters for data acquired with an Orbitrap instrument with 70000 resolution at reference m/z of 200 and expected peak width in retention time of 20 seconds (FWHM).</p>
<pre><code>import pastaq

params = pastaq.default_parameters(&#39;orbitrap&#39;, 20)
params[&#39;resolution_ms1&#39;] = 70000
params[&#39;reference_mz&#39;] = 200</code></pre>
<h4 id="input-files">Input files</h4>
<p>Input files can be passed to the pipeline in the following way:</p>
<pre><code>input_files = [
    {&#39;reference&#39;: False, &#39;raw_path&#39;: &#39;1_1.mzXML&#39;, &#39;group&#39;: &#39;a&#39;, &#39;ident_path&#39;: &#39;1_1.mzid&#39;},
    {&#39;reference&#39;: False, &#39;raw_path&#39;: &#39;1_2.mzXML&#39;, &#39;group&#39;: &#39;a&#39;, &#39;ident_path&#39;: &#39;1_2.mzid&#39;},
    {&#39;reference&#39;: False, &#39;raw_path&#39;: &#39;1_3.mzXML&#39;, &#39;group&#39;: &#39;a&#39;, &#39;ident_path&#39;: &#39;1_3.mzid&#39;},
    {&#39;reference&#39;: False, &#39;raw_path&#39;: &#39;2_1.mzXML&#39;, &#39;group&#39;: &#39;b&#39;, &#39;ident_path&#39;: &#39;2_1.mzid&#39;},
    {&#39;reference&#39;: False, &#39;raw_path&#39;: &#39;2_2.mzXML&#39;, &#39;group&#39;: &#39;a&#39;, &#39;ident_path&#39;: &#39;2_2.mzid&#39;},
    {&#39;reference&#39;: False, &#39;raw_path&#39;: &#39;2_3.mzXML&#39;, &#39;group&#39;: &#39;a&#39;, &#39;ident_path&#39;: &#39;2_3.mzid&#39;},
]</code></pre>
<p>If <code>reference</code> is enabled for a single file, it will be used for retention time alignment. If it is set for multiple files, a similarity search will be performed to find the most optimal reference for alignment. If the <code>reference</code> field is not present in any files or set to false in all of them, an exhaustive similarity search will be performed to identify the optimal reference for retention alignment of the whole dataset.</p>
<p><code>raw_path</code> specifies the path to the <code>.mzXML</code> or <code>.mzML</code> file, and <code>ident_path</code> the corresponding identification file in <code>.mzIdentML</code> version 1.1+ format.</p>
<p>The <code>group</code> is used for the selection of isotope peaks or features that are present in at least a given percentage of samples in any given group as described below.</p>
<h4 id="instrument-configuration">Instrument configuration</h4>
<p>These parameters are used mostly for configuring the extent of smoothing that is applied when resampling the data and the initial estimation of the region-of-interest (ROI) for the quantification of isotope peaks via peak fitting.</p>
<h5 id="instrument_type"><code>instrument_type</code></h5>
<p>This parameter defines the type of mass spectrometer used for data acquisition. Currently, PASTAQ supports Orbitrap (<code>orbitrap</code>), time-of-flight (<code>tof</code>), (triple) quad (<code>quad</code>) and Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance (<code>fticr</code>).</p>
<h5 id="resolution_ms1-resolution_msn-reference_mz"><code>resolution_ms1</code>, <code>resolution_msn</code>, <code>reference_mz</code></h5>
<p>The selected resolution at the MS1 (<code>resolution_ms1</code>) and MS2 (<code>resolution_msn</code>) levels with respect to the reference m/z (<code>reference_mz</code>).</p>
<h5 id="avg_fwhm_rt"><code>avg_fwhm_rt</code></h5>
<p>Estimated peak width in seconds of chromatographic peaks given as full-width half-maximum. A preliminary exploration of some selected isotope peaks from the extracted-ion chromatogram (XIC) or base-peak chromatogram (BIC) can be used to measure a rough estimate of this parameter. Peak widths can vary widely throughout the chromatographic range, so it is not necessary to provide an accurate measurement. The current implementation expects no change in peak width during the chromatographic elution, however, the Gaussian peak fitting algorithm is tolerant to variations peak width in chromatographic peaks.</p>
<h4 id="raw-data">Raw data</h4>
<p>If users want to process only a subrange in the m/z and/or retention time dimensions, they can do so by adjusting <code>min_mz</code>, <code>max_mz</code>, <code>min_rt</code> and <code>max_rt</code> parameters. Additionally, if the data contains scans in both positive and negative polarities, the <code>polarity</code> setting must be set to either <code>'pos'</code> or <code>'neg'</code>. Failure to do so will impact further pre-processing steps such as resampling and peak detection. Positive and negative polarities should thus be separated in different output directories.</p>
<h4 id="resampling">Resampling</h4>
<p>These parameters can be used for controlling the extent of smoothing applied to the data when resampling and to adjust the size of the output matrix. The resampling procedure will project the raw data into a regular 2D map in which the expected widths of peaks in both the retention time and m/z dimensions remain the same throughout their respective ranges. This ensures that the number of sampling points for all isotope peaks will be similar in the entire map.</p>
<p>By default, <code>num_samples_mz</code> and <code>num_samples_rt</code> establish that there will be at least 5 sampling points within the FWHM of a peak in each dimension. This should be sufficient for the estimation of initial local-maxima, but if not enough memory is available in the system, it may be reduced at the user’s discretion.</p>
<p>The amount of smoothing can be controlled with <code>smoothing_coefficient_mz</code> and <code>smoothing_coefficient_rt</code>, which act as a smoothing multiplier over the Gaussian kernel set at the estimated width (in sigma units) that is automatically calculated from the given instrumental settings and adjusted for local peak resolution in m/z dimension.</p>
<h4 id="peak-detection">Peak detection</h4>
<p>Detection of isotopic peaks is performed automatically based on previous settings, but the user may want to configure a maximum number of peaks to keep with the <code>max_peaks</code> parameter. It is advised to keep this parameter at high value, as noise discrimination is performed in the later peak matching stages of the pipeline without</p>
<h4 id="retention-time-alignment">Retention time alignment</h4>
<p>The retention time alignment algorithm (Warp2D) divides the retention time range of chromatograms in <code>warp2d_num_points</code> equidistant sampling points. Windows of <code>warp2d_window_size</code> number of points are used to establish the nodes at which the warping will occur. The <code>warp2d_slack</code> indicates how many points the warping nodes can be moved to shorten or extend a segment. When comparing the similarity of each of the segment during the warping, a maximum number of the most abundant isotope peaks (<code>warp2d_peaks_per_window</code>) can be adjusted, allowing to control the calculation time. Note that the retention time range is expanded by <code>warp2d_rt_expand_factor</code> at the beginning and end of the retention time range to avoid edge effects.</p>
<p>As a practical example, if the retention time range goes from 0 to 1000 seconds, with <code>warp2d_num_points = 1000</code>, <code>warp2d_window_size = 100</code> and <code>warp2d_slack = 20</code>, the range will be divided in 1 second segments, with each alignment window being 100 seconds long, and we can have a maximum warping deviation of +/- 20 seconds.</p>
<p>The default parameters will work fine for common retention time run lengths, but we are working to simplify the parametrization of Warp2D to use a selected deviation in number of sigmas, similar to other parameters in the pipeline.</p>
<h4 id="deisotopingfeature-detection">Deisotoping/Feature detection</h4>
<p>Users generally do not need to manually adjust the parameters of the deisotoping/feature detection procedure since those parameters are derived automatically. However, users may want to adjust the <code>feature_detection_charge_states</code> parameter to select the set of possible charge states that will be explored.</p>
<h4 id="peakfeature-matching">Peak/Feature matching</h4>
<p>When matching peaks/features across multiple files, a tolerance in m/z and retention time in number of sigmas can be adjusted with <code>metamatch_n_sig_mz</code> and <code>metamatch_n_sig_rt</code> respectively. Additionally, there is a filtering procedure that ensures that only clusters of matched peaks that contain non-zero values in a given percentage of samples are kept. This process works on individual groups, so if <code>metamatch_fraction = 0.7</code>, with 10 samples from group <code>a</code> and 20 of group <code>b</code>, a cluster will be retained if there are at least 7 samples from group <code>a</code> or 14 samples from group <code>b</code> with non-zero values.</p>
<h4 id="annotation-linking-and-identifications">Annotation linking and identifications</h4>
<p>As with other PASTAQ algorithms, the tolerance for linking MS/MS annotations and identifications is expressed in number of sigmas in m/z and retention time using the parameters <code>link_n_sig_mz</code> and <code>link_n_sig_rt</code>, respectively. In general, for linked peptide-spectrum-matches (PSMs), we may want to keep all the identifications, the user may want to keep all the identifications, not only the ones that has the highest scores, the parameter <code>ident_max_rank_only</code> should be set to <code>False</code>. Similarly, to keep annotations that don’t meet the FDR threshold or are marked as decoy, the parameters <code>ident_require_threshold</code> and <code>ident_ignore_decoy</code> should be set to <code>False</code>, respectively.</p>
<h4 id="quality-control-plots">Quality control plots</h4>
<p>A number of parameters are available to configure the appearance of quality control plots. A color palette can be set with <code>qc_plot_palette</code> parameter, which will accept any color palette included in the <code>seaborn</code> library (<code>husl</code>, <code>crest</code>, <code>Spectral</code>, <code>Flare</code>, etc.). By default image format is set to <code>png</code>. Other formats can be set using <code>qc_plot_extension</code> parameter using common image formats, such as <code>pdf</code>, <code>eps</code>, <code>tiff</code> or <code>svg</code>. The following configuration parameters, can be used to adjust the general style of the output images: <code>qc_plot_dpi</code> (Image DPI), <code>qc_plot_font_family</code> (Font family, e.g. <code>'serif'</code>, <code>'sans-serif'</code>), <code>qc_plot_font_size</code>, <code>qc_plot_fig_size_x</code>, <code>qc_plot_fig_size_y</code>. Plot legends are not enabled by default, to show the legend, set <code>qc_plot_fig_legend</code> to <code>True</code>. However, this may make certain plots with large number of chromatograms difficult to read.</p>
<p>When plots contain multiple samples, opacity (alpha) can be decreased to blend the different colors. The alpha channel can be controlled for each type of plot by changing <code>qc_plot_fill_alpha</code>, <code>qc_plot_line_alpha</code>, <code>qc_plot_scatter_alpha</code> to a number between 0.0 and 1.0. Alpha can be dynamically selected by setting these parameters to <code>'dynamic'</code> instead. In that case the alpha would be calculated as <code>alpha = 1 / n_samples</code>, and will never go below the value in <code>qc_plot_min_dynamic_alpha</code>.</p>
<p>If <code>qc_plot_per_file</code> is used, individual images will be generated for each QC plot, instead of having all plots stacked in one figure. Other adjustable QC plot parameters include <code>qc_plot_line_style</code>, which will show certain plots (e.g. XIC, density) as filled plots or line plots by selecting <code>'fill'</code> or <code>'line'</code>, respectively. In some cases, the amount of points in the <code>mz vs sigma_mz</code> scatterplot may be too large for visual assessment, therefore, <code>qc_plot_mz_vs_sigma_mz_max_peaks</code> will select a maximum number of points to use, and <code>qc_plot_scatter_size</code> parameter can be used to set the point size.</p>
<p>Similarity plots use the number of most intensive peaks set in <code>similarity_num_peaks</code>.</p>
<h4 id="quantitative-table-generation">Quantitative table generation</h4>
<p>A number of quantitative metrics are calculated in different stages of the pipeline. All this information is stored for the generation of the output <code>csv</code> tables. To avoid generating unnecessary files, a quantitative metric must be selected for isotopes (<code>quant_isotopes</code>) and features (<code>quant_features</code>). Isotope quantification can be set to peak height (<code>'height'</code>) or peak volume (<code>'volume'</code>). Likewise, features quantitative information can be based either on the monoisotopic peak (<code>'monoisotopic_height'</code>, <code>'monoisotopic_volume'</code>), the peak with the highest intensity (<code>'max_height'</code>, <code>'max_volume'</code>) or the sum of all peaks in the isotopic distribution (<code>'total_height'</code>, <code>'total_volume'</code>).</p>
<p>When identification information is provided and <code>quant_features_charge_state_filter</code> is set to <code>True</code>, annotations for features in which the MS1 charge state differs from the one in the identification file will be discarded in the feature quantitative tables.</p>
<p>The type of annotation linkage in <code>quant_ident_linkage</code> can be set to <code>theoretical_mz</code> or <code>msms_event</code>, which set the annotations type in the annotation tables either based on theoretical value of the highest scoring PSM or based on precursor ion m/z stored in the raw data.</p>
<p>When identifications are present in more than one sample, a consensus identification is generated for each peak or feature cluster as long as <code>quant_consensus</code> is enabled. This consensus will select the identifications that appear in the maximum number of files. Additionally will ignore identifications that are not present in at least <code>quant_consensus_min_ident</code> number of samples. By default, this is 2, but more stringent criteria could be used to reduce false positives.</p>
<p>By default all annotations are saved with their corresponding associative tables in addition to the aggregated versions. This can lead to very large files, and thus <code>quant_save_all_annotations</code> can be disabled to save some time and disk space.</p>
<p>Peptide tables are generated by aggregating clusters with the same consensus sequence by summing up multiple charge states of the same peptide. For protein group quantification it is necessary to use protein inference to select which peptides to aggregate for which protein. A minimum number of peptides present for a protein can be selected with <code>quant_proteins_min_peptides</code>. If <code>quant_proteins_remove_subset_proteins</code> is enabled, peptides are only considered for quantification of proteins (razor protein) with the highest number of mapped peptides following parsimonious law. In case a peptide can’t be assigned to a unique protein as ‘razor’ the user can choose to use them for quantification of all mapping proteins where the peptide could be considered as razor (<code>quant_proteins_ignore_ambiguous_peptides</code> is set to <code>False</code>) or to ignore them (<code>quant_proteins_ignore_ambiguous_peptides</code> is set to <code>True</code>). For protein inference, the following quantifications can be selected with the <code>quant_proteins_quant_type</code> parameter:</p>
<ul>
<li>‘unique’: Only unique peptides are considered for quantification.</li>
<li>‘razor’: Unique and peptides assigned as most likely according to the Occam’s razor constrain.</li>
<li>‘all’: All peptides will be used for quantification for all protein groups. Thus shared peptides will be used more than once.</li>
</ul>
